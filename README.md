# Swift-Server-Side-Tutorial

This repository regards a simple Server Side App that let's you operate different CRUD operations on a dedicated Database. The project contained in this repository should be considered together with the one of the client App for iOS which employs the REST APIs implemented to communicate and receive (or update) datas contained inside the database. 

For this Server Side App it has been employed Heroku Database service in order to deploy the App and make the database URL available from everywhere.

To find out more about the two projects and the main topics related I invite you to read my Medium Article:
